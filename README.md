# File Upload Demo with Spring Boot and Thymeleaf

<p>In this code-along demo, we will be uploading a file in a Spring Boot with Thymeleaf application. Visually, we have a file upload page for selecting and uploading the file, and a status page to see the result. Endpoints on the backend will handle the file upload and place it in a local directory.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>File Upload Page:</strong> The visually appealing file upload page allows users to select a file and upload it.</li>
  <li><strong>Status Page:</strong> After the file upload is completed, users can navigate to the status page to see the result.</li>
  <li><strong>Backend Endpoints:</strong> The backend of the application provides endpoints that handle the file upload process and store the uploaded file in a local directory.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.</li>
  <li>Ensure you have Java and Maven installed on your system.</li>
  <li>Build the project using the <code>mvn clean install</code> command.</li>
  <li>Run the application using the <code>mvn spring-boot:run</code> command.</li>
  <li>Open a web browser and visit <code>http://localhost:8080</code> to access the file upload page.</li>
  <li>Select a file and click the upload button.</li>
  <li>Navigate to the status page to see the upload result.</li>
</ol>
